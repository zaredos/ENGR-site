                <h2>Needs Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team decided to create a set of foldable dog steps for our project. The steps would be made of a series of steps that could be folded in on each other, and would be sturdy enough to support the weight of a large dog. The steps would be portable and easy to store, and would be able to be used in a variety of situations and heights. The steps would be made of PLA filament and would be printed on a Prusa Mini.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Sketching a design</h2>
                <p>
                    For our sixth project in Engineering, our team spent a long time in the thought process of what we wanted to create. We eventually decided on creating a dog steps, rather than a dog ramp, as we believed that it would be more versatile and could be used in more situations. The steps we were envisioning were made up of a series of sturdy thick steps which could support the full weight of a large dog. Rather than have the steps be fixed in place in relation to each other, we envisioned steps that could be folded in on itself as well as fully extended, allowing for the steps to be used in a variety of situations and heights. The foldable aspect of the steps also would serve to make the steps more portable and easier to store for its owner. Below are some sketches of this initial design:

                </div>

                <h2>Iteration 1</h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to first create a small basic prototype of the steps, not foldable or with screws, but a simple set of steps in order to test the basic concept. This would be a fully connected singular piece made in Fusion, which we could 3D print a smaller scale version of. We would then test this prototype on a variety of weights and surfaces to see if the concept was feasible. Once finished, we printed our first version using PrusaSlicer and a Prusa Mini. Below are some images of our first iteration:
                </p>

                <div class="container">

                        <div class="col-md-6">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Although the steps were functional and could indeed assist a dog in climbing up to a higher surface, we realized that the steps were not as sturdy as we would have liked. Even though it was a smaller print, the steps were a little wobbly and the supports were not as strong as we would have liked. We realized that screws would be necessary to make these steps foldable.
                </p>

                <h2>Iteration 2</h2>
                <p>
                    For our second iteration, we decided to test out screws that could be inserted in and out easily, as well as be rotatable for our foldable design. After some research, we found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:130879">these pin connectors</a>, which had a unique design similar to our prosthetic hands - they could be squeezed and inserted easily, but also loose enough to allow rotation. We imported a design into Fusion with the adjusted hole sizes and pins, and printed out a second iteration. Below are some images of our second iteration:
                </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <img src="assets/4-8/second_iteraton_fusion.png">
                            <p class="caption">Creating the pinhole design in fusion</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <img src="assets/4-8/second_iteration.jpg">
                            <p class="caption">The finished print...</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Although the print was successful, the pins were too large to fit inside the holes. We realized that we would need to adjust the design to make the pins smaller or make the holes larger in the side of the steps. It also may have been caused by the fact that the design was printed at a very small scale (for time purposes), and that this may have also been a primary cause of the pins not fitting, as larger pins would be easier to squeeze into the holes.
                </p>
                <h2>Iteration 3</h2>
                <p>
                    For our third iteration, we wanted to use the knowledge gained from the mistakes of our previous iterations to create a print that could both be folded and sturdy. We decided to create 5 separate steps - 3 large and 2 small, which could be folded in on each other. Each of these steps would contain holes on the sides where the 3D printed pins could be inserted. There would be a large amount of side supports which would be connecting the steps together and attached via the pins, which would move to guide the steps into place as it folded in and out. Below are some images of our third iteration being printed in PrusaSlicer:
                </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">

                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <img src="assets/4-8/iteraton_3_screws_fusion.png">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Although each print was a success, the pins would not fit into the holes, similar to our second design print. We reprinted the pins at 90% of its original scale, and once done they could just barely fit snugly into the holes if squeezed tightly, which was perfect. We assembled the 5 steps together and tested the foldable design, which worked perfectly. The steps were sturdy and could support a large amount of weight, and the pins were easy to insert and remove. We were very happy with the third design. Below are some images of it in action:

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Iteration 4</h2>
                <p>
                    For our fourth iteration, we wanted to test the functionality of a new function which was shown in one of our previous sketches - the usage of cranks or clamps. Our ideal design would not be the complete steps, but rather a small kit with instructions on how to create the steps, which would include the cranks. This would allow our design to be much more accessible and customizable to the user. The issue with using pins is that taking apart and putting the steps back together again repeatedly could be tedious, and the pins could be lost. Cranks would allow for the steps to be easily folded and unfolded without the need for pins, providing an easy option for attaching to the side of steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our clamp design, we printed out 3 separate parts. The base, which would have a screw hole inside of it that a screw could be inserted into easily. The screw, which had a small handle and could be screwed into the base. And the protector, which would just be inserted into the screw to help protect it from damage. After finalizing a small design in Fusion, we printed out the parts and assembled them. Below are some images of our fourth iteration:

                    </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we believe that the design is going well. We have a fully functional set of steps that can be folded and unfolded easily, and have ordered wood blocks (1 in x 8 in x 8 ft) which we can cut into pieces use to test as a full scale model. We are excited to see how the final product will turn out.
