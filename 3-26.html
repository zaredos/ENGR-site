                <h2>The Dog Ramp</h2>
                <p>
                    For our fifth project in Engineering, our team decided to create a dog ramp. This was a tool that was to be used by dogs who have trouble climbing up into cars, beds, or couches, specifically those with arthritis or other mobility issues. Typically, these dogs cannot access such elevated spaces without the assistance of a human being, and while smaller dogs had the option of being lifted or carried easily, larger and heavier dogs often could not. Our goal was to create a dog ramp or stairs that could be used by large dogs of this size and could be distributed to those in need.

                <p>
                    Although these products are great for their intended purposes, we wanted to create a ramp that was more versatile and could be used by larger dogs. In particular, the PawRamp was more similar to what we were envisioning, however, it was incredibly expensive and couldn't hold the larger dogs that we were aiming to help. The Frisco Steps, while more affordable, were meant for smaller breeds and were not as versatile as we wanted. We decided to create a ramp that was adjustable in height and could support large breeds, which would be more suitable for larger dogs. We also wanted to make sure that the ramp was lightweight and easy to transport, as well as sustainable and affordable.
                </p>

                <h2>What was necessary in our design</h2>
                <p>
                    We still were able to learn a lot from the aformentioned products, and decided that the following would be desirable in our design:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adjustable heights</li>
                        <li>Non-slip, comfortable surface</li>
                        <li>Can support large breeds</li>
                        <li>Easy to transport</li>
                        <li>Lightweight</li>
                        <li>Sturdy/Good Structural Support</li>
                        <li>Affordable</li>
                        <li>Sustainable</li>
                    </ul>

                    In order to achieve these goals, we decided that the best course of action would be to create a ramp made from thick laser-cut wood or another sturdy material. We would then add a non-slip surface to the ramp, and create a hinge that would allow the ramp to be adjusted to different heights. We could also add a handle to the ramp to make it easier to transport, and make sure that the ramp was lightweight enough to be carried by a single person. Just like in the other products we researched, rubber stoppers would be added to the bottom of the ramp to prevent it from slipping, and the ramp would be designed to be sturdy and supportive enough to hold large breeds. Finally, we would make sure that the ramp was affordable and sustainable, and could be assembled and disassembled for storage.

                <h2>Testing our product</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to know if our product is successful or not, we would need to do extensive testing for the ramp. In order to accomplish this, we decided the best way would be to laser cut and print a smaller scale prototype of the ramp base, and test it on a variety of weights and surfaces. We could then adjust the prototype as needed in order to not waste too much material. Once we were satisfied with the prototype, we could then move on to creating a full-scale version of the ramp and test it on real dogs. We could then adjust the ramp as needed based on the feedback we received from the dogs and their owners, and make sure that the ramp was safe and comfortable for the dogs to use.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, we believe that this project is fully possible and that we can create a ramp that is affordable, sustainable, and versatile enough to be used by large dogs. Although there are already existing solutions to this problem, these solutions are often expensive and not suitable for larger breeds. We believe that our ramp will be able to fill this gap in the market and provide a useful tool for those in need. Although we haven't found a client for our product yet, we believe that there is a demand for such a ramp and that we will be able to find a suitable client in the future.
