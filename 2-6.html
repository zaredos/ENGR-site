                <h2>Remaking My Nametag</h2>
                <p>For my latest 3D printing project, I decided to remake my nametag from scratch using TinkerCAD. Learning from my previous experience, I wanted to add more texture and life to the nametag, so I incorporated different objects like stars and scribbles. The design process was both fun and challenging as I experimented with shapes and arrangements, ultimately settling on a design with my name centered amidst the various elements.</p>
                <h2>Printing with PrusaSlicer</h2>
                <p>After finalizing the design, I used PrusaSlicer to prepare the model for printing. I opted for a 20% infill and decided to print without supports or brim to simplify the process. Using the PRUSA Mini and Prusament PLA filament, the printing process took approximately 27 minutes. I monitored the print closely, eagerly anticipating the outcome.</p>
                <h2>Successful Outcome</h2>
                <p>The end result exceeded my expectations. The nametag turned out beautifully, with the added texture giving it a unique and vibrant appearance. Unlike my previous attempt, I encountered no issues during the printing process, and the nametag emerged flawlessly from the printer. Below are several photos showcasing different angles of the finished nametag:</p>

                <h2>Combination Print with Fusion360</h2>
                <p>For my second project, I delved into Fusion360 to create a combination print. I utilized the combine tool to merge a mesh of a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2120591">phone stand</a> with <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6363359">charging cable holders</a>. The design incorporated two cable holders positioned near the bottom of the phone holder, allowing for convenient charging while the phone is both vertical and horizontal.</p>
                <p>After exporting the file as an STL, I imported it into PrusaSlicer for slicing. Similar to the nametag, I opted for a 20% infill and used organic tree supports to facilitate easy removal. The printing process began in our classroom on Friday, with an estimated duration of 5 hours.</p>
                <p>Upon returning to class on Tuesday, I eagerly retrieved the print. I was delighted with the outcome—the holder turned out precisely as envisioned. The next step was testing it out on my friend's iPhone, and I'm pleased to report that it worked flawlessly. Below are photos showcasing the print with supports and in use with a phone:</p>
